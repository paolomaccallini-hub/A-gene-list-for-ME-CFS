In this study, I generated a comprehensive gene list aimed at aiding variant prioritization in next-generation sequencing (NGS) for cases of suspected Mendelian Myalgic Encephalomyelitis. Using experimental associations from relevant literature as a seed, I expanded the list by retrieving interacting genes via the STRING database API, focusing on high-confidence interactions. Pathway enrichment analysis of this expanded list highlighted glycosylation, glycan biosynthesis, metabolism, and energy metabolism as the key areas of investigation in the context of ME/CFS.
